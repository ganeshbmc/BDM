price elasticity of demand = (% change in qty demanded) / (% change in price)

Therefore,
% change in qty = (price elasticity) * (% change in price)

		= 1.2 * ((200-50)/200)
		
		= 1.2 * 0.75

% change in qty = 0.9

That is,

(old qty - new qty) / old qty = 0.9
new qty = old qty - (0.9 * old qty)

Therefore,

new qty = 0.1 * old qty
